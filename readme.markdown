## Usage

```text
USAGE:
    nametag [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help          Prints help information
    -t, --title-case    Uses Title Case for words in generated usernames
    -V, --version       Prints version information
    -v, --verbose       Prints verbose output, including parameters as received

OPTIONS:
    -l, --list <list-file-path>       Provide a txt file with a list of words to generate username from randomly
    -m, --maximum <maximum-length>    Set maximum username length. Must be greater than 5 [default: 100]
    -n, --number <number-to-print>    Set how many random usernames to output [default: 10]
```

If the `maximum` option is set less than 11, nametag will only pull one word from the word list. If it's set to 11 or higher, it will pull two words from the word list.

**Note**: This program is NOT intended to be used to create secure passwords. **Do NOT use this program to create passwords.**

## Usage examples

- `nametag` generates 10 random usernames from included word lists (see below)
- `nametag -l path/to/a/custom_wordlist.txt` generates 10 random usernames using words from provided `.txt` file, where each word is on its own line
- `nametag -n 5 -m 12` generates 5 random usernames with a maximum length of 12 characters.
- `nametag -n 5 -t` generates 5 random usernames where each word is in Title Case.

## Installation

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you haven't already
2. Run: `cargo install --git https://github.com/sts10/nametag`

## Installation with Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
2. Clone this repo and move into the created directory: `git clone https://github.com/sts10/nametag && cd nametag`
3. Run: `docker-compose up`

### Docker Notes

- During development run `docker-compose up --build` when changing Rust code and adding word lists to rebuild with new code and/or dependencies.

- To change the command nametag is run with, edit the command in `docker-compose.yml`. Make sure to keep `./` before `nametag` as provided in the default. For example: `./nametag -v -l /nametag/word-lists/eff_large_wordlist.txt`

- It is recommended to add user provided word lists into the `word-list` directory and use either the absolute path (`/nametag/word-lists/custom_wordlist.txt`) or relative path (`./word-lists/custom_wordlist.txt`) when using them as an argument .

## On the included word lists

If no word list is provided, nametag uses one or two word lists from [the SecureDrop project](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/) to create usernames. If the maximum length allows (or is not specified), usernames will be in "[adjective](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/securedrop/dictionaries/adjectives.txt) + [noun](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/securedrop/dictionaries/nouns.txt) + number" format. If the maximum length is set below 11 characters, nametag will use a "noun + number" format.

If the user provides a word list of their own, using the `-l` option, nametag will use that provided list to generate _both_ words. 

If you're looking to create or edit a word list, you might find useful another tool I built called [tidy](https://github.com/sts10/tidy).
